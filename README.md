## 
:flashlight:  Over five years of experience in development, graduated in Systems Analysis and Development with a postgraduate degree in Software Architecture. Focused on back-end development using languages such as Java and Go/Golang, with strong expertise in PL/SQL and SQL, knowledge in Docker configuration, git, DDD, Clean Architecture, and microservices.

💡 I believe in sharing knowledge and the concept of anti-fragility to evolve as a professional and as a human being.
